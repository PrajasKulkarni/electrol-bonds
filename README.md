Here I am using flask, with mysql for creating a simple website to search for data of electrol bonds.
The process of creating the Flask website is as follows:
1) I converted the PDF files into CSV files using the Fitz library.
2) Then I imported the CSV files to MySQL schema into two different tables, giving names file1 and file2
3) Then, I set up the Flask server in the virtual environment so that the project files wouldn't damage the original Python in my system.
4) I installed other modules required for locally hosting the website and then connected with the MySQL database after installing it myself.
5) After connecting to mysql daatabse, i created a simplpe html page index.html shoing hello world on the screen.
6)  Then I put all the necessary firsthand things in one file base.html, which will load all the essential contents on the page first and then all the other content will appear on the screen.
7)  Using Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript, I set up my welcome page and created a navbar with a link to search for specific questions on different pages.

9) Then, I created separate pages and put them into the templates folder for rendering from the Python file.
10) I put the CSS and javascript files in the static folder and all the images so they can be accessed.
11) I included a bar chart for one of the questions showing the amount donated by each company using Chart.js.![Screenshot (21)](https://github.com/PrajasKulkarni/electrol-bonds/assets/143334158/2db02048-b771-457b-8629-7f6e373f43c2)
12) Hence, I was able to complete my assignment in due time.
